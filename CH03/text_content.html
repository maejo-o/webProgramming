        <p>hat was something he had been unable to do last June, when he announced he was suffering from facial paralysis because of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
            “It is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis,” he said at the time in a video he posted on Instagram. “As you can see this eye is not blinking. I can’t smile on this side of my face; this nostril will not move. So there’s full paralysis on this side of my face
            The syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that occurs when the varicella-zoster virus infects a nerve in the head near the inner ear. It initially caused Bieber to postpone remaining dates in his Justice World Tour.</p>

        <p>Rihanna is expanding her empire once again.</p>
        <p>The 33-year-old pop star and entrepreneur plunked down $10 million for a 5,000-square-foot home in Beverly Hills, California, at the end of March, according to property records.
         The Tudor-style house is right next door to the newly renovated, 8,000-square-foot mansion she purchased for $13.75 million at the end of last year</p>
        <p>Rihanna’s cosmetics and fashion brands have established her as the world’s wealthiest female musician with a net worth of $600 million, according to Forbes.</p>
        <p>Both properties, located in the posh Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhood, were purchased through trusts. Evan Jehle, a partner at the New York-based business management company FFO and a member of the Global Advisory Board of Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation, is listed as a trustee on deeds for the two transactions, according to public records on PropertyShark. Mr. Jehle could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
        <h1 id="gamma">Gamma</h1>
        <p>Meanwhile, her new Tudor-style home offers five bedrooms and five bathrooms, exposed ceiling beams and wood details throughout, a sauna, half-basketball court and pool, 
            according to listing photos from 2015. The sellers did not return requests for comment.</p>
